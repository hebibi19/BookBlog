        <p><u>review:</u> i literally got post book depression after i finished this,,,,, so,,,
          if thats any indicator of how good it was there it is,,, if i need to say more then this
          fic broke my heart,, i was in actual tears those last 2 chapters,, and I know for a fact
          theres two chapters left and i will probably also cry during those chapters and once its all
          compelte im going to format it into a book format and then im going to print it out for myself
          and then im going to place it on the shelf next to atyd where they will both stand there and
          taunt me bc of how much pain they bring me,,,, i literally am so sad and so mad that i cannot
          exist in the same universe as them i am actually mad liek i get physically upset if i think about
          it for too long ALSO its so sad that literally no one gets a happy ending like they have the absolute
          best years of their lives and they think theyre going to be invincible and then they have to deal with
          the war andn its alwqays the most heartbreaking stuff to read and i always get so sad</p>

            <p><u>review:</u> as much as i absolutely love this book i dont think it fully deserves
              the 10/10 rating just yet,, still a 9.5 is still very high.. i literally love the entire
              cast of characters but i think i love the chaos that ensues after the first book more,,
              all of the personalities have been established so now we can focus more on the dynamics
              and the chaos,,, especially ty and kit (who later on become by favs),, i had a love hate
               relationship w julian by the time i finished the last book and i honeslty cant rememebr
               why i hated him bc right now i think hes a little stupid but i love him bc of how manipulative
               he is,,,, also!! the original gang is liek 23 years old now!! i cannot believe it.</p>

            <p><u>review:</u> i tried so hard to like this book i really did but I just coundnt
              find myself liking any of the characters enough,, like i really didnt care about who
              died and who didnt,,, the chapters also went by really slowly for me and i just wasnt
              immersed in the story,,, i know it was the first book of the series but i feel like it
              shouldve been a bit more interesting,,, also should each book have a book plot and an
              overarching plot?,,,  i dont know what the book plot was,,, dont start a war? i feel
              like the war is the overarching plot no? anyway didnt like very much,, i dont think
              its a bad bookl,, like i have no literary criticisms,, its actually just me,, i just
              couldnt read it im sorry,,,, </p>
