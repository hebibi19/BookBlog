      <p><u>review:</u> every single time i have to review one of these books i literally never
        know how to go about it because they can’t be explained. all i can really talk about each
        time is the characters and how beautifully written their relationships are. also,, i just
        really love ronan,, idk what it is about him he reminds me of some other character that i
        cant quite name, its just AH! u know? theres one line from this book specifically that has
        stuck by me for years because i saw it a long time ago in a tiktok and i didnt understand what
        it meant, but that line is “adam lived in an apartment located above the office of St.Agnes Cathloic
        Church, a fortuitious combination that focused most of the objects of Ronan’s worship into one
        downtown block”,,,, LIKE!!! OH MY GODDD,,,,,, anyway i love how everyone was written and while
        adam wasnt always my favorite i did love him as much as i loved everyone else,, im sad its over
        and i cant wait until i can reread them and catch new things i couldnt catch the first time i
        read them :)</p>

          <p><u>review:</u> this book really attacked my daddy issues. like it emotionally devastated me. as far
            as first books in a series go, I think this book was amazing. was it an extremely slow and difficult
            start? yes,, i found it hard to really engage myself in with the story and it was just so much
            information about the maguc system and the world around them that for almost half the book,
            you don’t even know how you feel about the characters because you havent really been told much
            about them. despite that! i think that the magic system is really cool and everything else about
            the world is really cool and i didnt think id be able to understand it all, but as you keep going
            it just get easier u know. the plot, i feel wasn’t really there,, like they had an end goal and there
            were all these steps that they were taking to achieve their goal (bc it was like a heist type mission)
            but i feel as if the book focused a lot more of the characters establishing them and their dynamics.
            (which personally, I love) now the characters! the book was a dual POV switching back and forth
            between the two main characters vin and kell (which first of all, love dual pov),,, secondly,, i
            love vin with all my heart like all i want for her is to be happy,, kell,, we had a rocky patch but
            i still reallly loved him. and the dyanmic between the two,, oh my god beautful. overall, i really
            liked it and i thought the writing flowed really well,,, i have absolutely no idea how the rest of
            the story is gnna go, so im scared for that,, but also excited.</p>

          <p><u>review:</u> overall, the book was okay,,, it definitely does not match up with the
            first book which i thought was amazing. it was captivating and entertaining and interesting in
            all aspects. that could have been because of all of the tropes,, it was a heist and it was a
            branch of found family and it had a couple of aspects of that enemies to lovers,,, but this book was
            different. obviously, i knew that there wasnt going to be a heist,, and that the romance was
            nonexistent, but i at least expected a little more. I cant say that the book wasnt entertainign bc
            it was, it definitelyt was that... but its hard to claim that it was entertaining when the first
            book obviously did a much better job at that. there were certain aspects of this book that made me
            keep going and it definitely was not the dynamic between the two main characters,,, after a couple
            hundred pages, it gets a little repetitive when their thinking is exactly the same about how they r
            egard each other,,,three side characters were my  favorites (tensoon, spook, zane),, i thought one
            of them was going to be more important than he actually was,, the other has disappeared but i hope
            he comes back,, and the third got so little screentime but i relished it when it happened. this book
            wouldnt pass the bechdel test,,, LMAOOOOO neither would the first one honestly,,, is it bc brandy
            doesnt know how to write women,, ,,,the book was extremely politicly focused,, there was a war,, so
            it was a lot of war planning and battle scenes and government meetings,,, none of which interest me,
            but at least brandy sandy had the decency to put interesting scenes in between political ones. am i
            excited for the last one? yes, i love the main characters (elend and vin), im interested in how
            one of them is going to do something specifically,, and honeslty i just love vin so anythign
            she does ill b cool w,, for a moment there i thought she was gnna have a villain arc tbh,, she
            did not,, but it wouldve been cool,,, im just hoping she doesnt have to die at the end
            bc i feel like its something she’d do.</p>

          <p><u>review:</u> at this point of the series i am fully invested in the characters,, i
            loved tensoon and vin and spook and elend (even tho i always joked about how they should kill
            him haha,,,, ) ,,, i am mad at brandy,,, why did he have to kill vin (sobbing meme),,,,, and i
            fr thought that he was gnna kill spook,,, like if spook died i wouldve stopped reading 100%,,,,
            i also thought tensoon was going to have a much larger role to play and i also thought he was gnna
            live!! all the kandra died!! that was so sad,,, i dont think anyone had an extremely sad death
            so i cant be extrememly sad about that (but maybe it wouldve been nice to include some sad deaths),,,
            i thought this book was def better than the last one and it was def more fast paced and obviously had
            more riding on it than the second book,,,, there were a few moments where brandy was putting together
            all of the hints for me but i was wayyy to stupid to actually get them so when they were revealed i was
            like :0,,,,, overall i think id give the series like a 8/10 or like a 7.9/10,,, just bc i didnt feel completely
            emotionally attached to as many characters as I would like to have been,,, also,, i guess i kinda just
            know when a series becomes a favorite, and while i could see the first book (and maybe the last book)
            def being up there,, im not completely sure they make it,,,, i knew immeadiately with the raven boys
            and the foxhole court and atyd,,, and as much as i would love to throw mistborn in with them, it just
            doesnt quite make it,,, sad, but true.</p>

          <p><u>review:</u>  okay,, so a little embarrased to admit this but i thot
            the book was gnna be about one thing and it wasnt,,,, so,,,,to be fair, i went in
            completely blind right?! so i had no idea what the book was about,, and in my head,
            for no reason,, i thought it was like the movie rope,, where the two main male leads are
            sociopaths and they plan to murder ppl and theyre also gay and have this tension between them,,,,,
            uhm thats not what i got at alll,, no idea why i thought there would be a romance subplot?
            and the entire 2/3s of the book i was like, yea thats gay they def had a thing at one point
            only to find out, that they indeed did not have a thing ever and the reason they were so
            observant of each other was bc they were sociopaths (so ig i got that part right),,,
            i also rememeber this book being marketed as “told throgh the villians perspective”,,,
            but victor was never the villain,,,, false advertising ig,,,also eli was never a likable
            character so that made him easy to hate,,, the book was really easy to read, like everything flowed
            so nicely and i love the format that it was wirtten in,, like the switching from back and forth in time
            was really cool, i feel like ive read a book/ watched a movie like that but i cant remember,,,</p>
