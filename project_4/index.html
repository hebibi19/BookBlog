              <p> <span class="opacity"> read: february</span> | let me just say that
                this is not a good book at all.... despite all of its flaws, i have
                named this book my favorite book of the year. its honestly so dramatic
                and insane and unpredictable, but it's also addicting and shocking
                and amazing and i love it <i>[book 3 of the all for the game trilogy]</i> </p>

              <p> <span class="opacity"> read: february</span> | this book man,,,
                especially after that first half?!! oh my god, the emotion! also!!
                that ENDING!!! probably the best part of the entire book, the way it was
                presented?! amazing. the execution: *chefs kiss*. the moment i put the
                book down i stared at my ceiling for a couple minutes. <i>[book 2 of

            <li> <a href="march.html"><b><u>The Raven Boys - Maggie Stiefvater</u></b></a> | (10/10)
              <p> <span class="opacity"> read: march</span> | the plot was incredibly confusing
                and i found myself just trying to feel my way through most of the time, but
                the one thing that hooked me in was the characters and the way they're presented
                to the reader with such distinct and incredible personalities. <i>

              <p> <span class="opacity"> read: april</span> | all i can really
                say about this book is that these characters evoke such a strong
                emotion in me that it cannot physically be explained. the character
                dynamics are written beautifully and it was honeslty such a great ending
                for the series. <i>[book 4 of the raven cycle series]</i>  </p>

              did i come into 2022 thinking i would be shipping james potter and regulus black?

              <p> <span class="opacity"> read: january</span> | whatever cassandra clare writes,
              i will most certainly read it. and i will love it. something about the way
              cassandra clare writes romance is so appealing to me. i eat it up, every.
              single. time. and the ending! for this.. on my knees, i NEEDED the next installation asap

              <p> <span class="opacity"> read: april</span> | this book was my introduction
              to high fantasy and it did not disappoint! the plot was a heist, which meant that
                the book was going to be amazing. (dont ask me those are just facts). also VIN!
                i loved her so much. the magic system was incredibly complex and yet simple to

              my favorite character in this series: mister ronan lynch. also gansey and blue!
              usually the middle books in series tend to be not as good since they focus on
              fleshing out the characters. however! i LOVE that! thats always been my favorite part

              i think that is how everyone should approach these books. they are 100% more
            enjoyable when you don't know a single thing about these. while this is my least
            favorite of the trio. as of june 2022, i have read this book 3 times. so yeah.

          not necessarily good books, but they kept me entertained <i>[click on the title to go to full review]</i></p>

            <li> <b><u>City of Heavenly Fire - Cassandra Clare</u></b> | (10/10)
              <p> <span class="opacity"> read: march</span> | the first time i read this book was around 8 years ago
                (i was 13? 14?). i had read all of the previous books in the series and
                i spent a year waiting for this book. it did not disappoint. rereading it
                the second time around gave me the same rush it gave me the first time and that
            makes me incredibly happy. the other books in the series aren't as great but this one holds a special place
            in my heart. <i>[book 6 of the mortal instruments series] </i></p>

            <li> <b><u>The Hero of Ages - Brandon Sanderson</u></b> | (8.5/10)
              <p> <span class="opacity"> read: april</span> | by this point in the trilogy
              i was fully invested in these characters. spook and tensoon and vin were probably
              my favorite characters out of the entire cast and i found myself looking forward to their
              chapters. while the pacing for this book was better than the second installment, nothing beats
              the first book in my opinion. <i>[book 3 of the mistborn trilogy]</i></p>

              <p> <span class="opacity"> read: may</span> | this was also a reread. i love this book for many
              reasons but specifially because of the blackthorn family. they have probably the saddest backstory
            out of all the cassandra clare characters, and its crazy because we got to experience it in the other series,
            and then we get their series and we find out that they're actuallly not okay! and its so sad but interesting
            to read about. <i> [book 1 of the dark artifices trilogy]</i></p>

              and it was a fun little book for me to read. now, i find it a little bittersweet. it is a
            sad story but its also very happy and very coming of age-esque. only around 100 pages, so quick read. </p>

              his grey area of morality and how we are supposed to believe that hes the villain (when he isnt).
             the book has a heist vibe to it and it also has a jumpy timeline. enjoyable read but i wouldnt recommend it often.

            the second to last book so that says a lot. i just love these characters a lot so im extremely

              i dont tend to read these types of books so when i do, its a nice little break from my norm. the timeline
            was all wacky and jumbled and the ending was bad, but overall enjoyable. i finished it in a day, so that means something.</p>
