          <p> (fanfiction) this one ruined me. completely entranced by the marauders.
          ive read these books 3 times in the span of 2 months. i had to physically stop
          myself from rereading them again.</p>

        <p><u>review:</u> these books man. well technically its only one book, but if you were
        to hypothetically separate them into books it would be a trilogy. the first book is good. everyone is happy
      relationshops are being established and everyone is doing okay. the second book is the best one. the mix of
        angst and happiness is perfect for me. the third book however,,,,, horrible. not in the sense that it was bad
        but because everyone was sad. like yes, i know theres a war going on but !! why is everyone sad all the time
        stop fighting amongst yourselves!!!,,,, grant was the BEST character out of all the books and he was
        only a secondary character so do with that what you will.</p>

        <p><u>review:</u> after v close consideration i think tessa did not love jem as
          much as he loved her and that makes me sad. like obviously they have a
          good ending and she does love him but i dont think they wouldve been
          able to get married just like that at this point in time. but ME? i
          couldve married jem i dont know about yall,, stay safe tho. i love
          jem have i mentioned that??</p>

        <p><u>review:</u> clockwork princess is the best book out of the three
          undeniably. well, im a sucker for second books in trilogies. it tends
          to be the book where almost nothing happens but theres a lot of character
          growth and i love that. but clockwork princess is special in its own
          regard bc of everything that happens in it. i love magnus and his
          connection to the shadowhunters and i love the lightwoods and i love
          when i first found out that brother zachariah was jem! oh my god i
          rememebr how shocked i was and it was amazing and it literally was a
          plot twist i never expected like it was crazy to know that i had been
          reading about him for 5 books and i never noticed. and then when city
          of heavenly fire came out and jem was in one of the final chapters as
          himself, ugh that was beautiful.</p>

        <p><u>review:</u> okay allegedly this trilogy is supposed to be better
          than the infernal devices and everyone says that but honestly i dont
          see it yet,,,, do i love all the characters? yes, is it more a found
          family  than the infernal devices ? yes and do i love it? also yes, but
          i just want everyone to be happy and absolutely no one is happy,,,, also
          i hate grace balckthorn. I love jesse blackthorn but i dont actually
          think they should bring him back to life bc that seems suspicious but
          also this new new generation of blackthorns has dark hair and so now
          im thinking that maybe they do bring him back and lucie and jesse
          get together because obviously theres some warped perception of love
          there. also love tessa and will and love how theyâ€™re always convieniently
          not there when danger is there. also think that james is gnna get possessed.</p>
