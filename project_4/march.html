            1 - 6. The Mortal Instruments - Cassandra Clare</a></h3>

        <h3><b>reread | rating overall (7.8/10)</b></h3>
        <p><u>review:</u> this series was more pleasant that I had expected it to be. this
        year I decided that I was going to reread all of cassandra clare's shadowhunter books, and
      unfortunately, this included the mortal instruemnts. The "are we siblings or not" romance plotline
        was very much not appreciated, however the secondary characters are really what made the books so
        nice to read. I absolutely adore simon and magnus and isabelle and alec and was honestly just reading
        for them at one point. Book 4 focuses most of its attention on Simon (love) and it also is where you
        begin to notice that the writing has improved into the cassie clare style we know today. the final book
        was still able to shock me like it did the first time when i read it in 8th grade and for that it deserves some love.</p>

        <p><u>review:</u> i find that if i go in expecting nothing i end up liking a book a lot
          more than if i go in expecting to like it. bcc i had absolutely no idea what these books
          were about other than my best friend really liked them and so i was like okayy shes given me her
          blessing to read her favorute books,,, and omg she did not disappoint,, likeeee,, i could
          not tell you what the plot was for the last half but i was extremely into it,, and the plot
          isnt even like the most importamt thing, the most important thing are the characters and
          their relationships with each other,, bc i love blue and gansey and adam,, and like its
          just interesting i feel like a child who discovered magic, like in bridge to terrabithia
          thats the emotion thats being invoked</p>

        <p><u>review:</u> this book revolved around ronan a lot more and i cannot say i hated it bc
          ronan gives me a lot of andrew vibes (foxhole court character)
           and then at the end of the book HES GAYY like brooo,, you cannot say there aren't certain parallels
           between ronan and andrew like chaotic, gay, anger issues,,, thats their whole brand.... anyway, this
           book was v good and i liked it a lot and blue and gansey!! and blue and noah!!! like!!!
           ahdksjhsadjawsjdh,, u know. again that last half of the book was confusing so i was just vibing but
           omg adam idc idc he needs therapy,,, excited for the next books </p>

        <p><u>review:</u>  okay so a lot keeps happening and im totally into it,, like in a general
          sense i know whats going on, but also i have no idea whats going on,, but thats not the
          important part, the important part is the gang.,,, gansey and blue mannnnnn idk how YA authors
          do this every single time without fail,, they just write romance wayyyy better than NA authors,,,
          anyway im so scared i feel like gansey is actually gnna die and stay dead,, like idk ,, and as much
          as i hold a little bit of dislike towards adam i want him to succeed so bad,, like yes! get out of
          this small town and do something for yourself ,,,,, ronan,, i just love ronan</p>
