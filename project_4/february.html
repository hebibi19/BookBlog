        <p><u>review:</u> was this rated higher than the last hours? yes, but
          for an entirely different reason,, i have standards for cassie clare,,
          i had no expectations for this book and it exceeded expectations.
          it was great i dont know what to tell you it was exactly what i needed,,,
          broken young adults looking for family,,, chased by the mafia,,,, and
          have weird obsessions with lacrosse. as for favorite characters;
          love neil, love andrew lowkey highkey,, and love andrewâ€™s cousin,,,,,
          dont know how i feel about kevin or andrews twin or anyone else on the
          team but thats okay bc i only love andrew the most really, hes just so
          unhindged i love it,, and a short king.</p>

        <p><u>review:</u> i was on the edge of my mf seat the whole time i was
          reading ths book,, i literally love andrew so much and neil like i would
          die for them like i dont know what it is,, if im being honest, bc i stayed
          up till like 4 reading i dont even remember what happened,,,,, actually,,
          u know what I do.. neil went to the ravens at the end of the book and i
           near lost mymind, andrew left to get sober,,, we got backstories on
           most if not all of the team and we got flirting moments between my two faves,,, </p>

        <p><u>review:</u> i dont know what it is about self published books like
          this but they know how to write people so well,, like they give them this
          whole personality and then we get to see little glimpses of them through neils
          eyes and i dont know what it is but its so humanizing, especially the way neil
          views andrew,, i loved all of their mannerisms so much it was what made the book
          amazing to me,, i think the last time i was this invested in a book was when
          i read ATYD for the first time,,, the range of emotions that hit me as i read
          these books was incredible,,, like it has not been matched for a while its
          crazy like i literally dont know how to describe it,,, this book was so crazy
          if i could have recorded all of my reactions last night i wouldve loved to see that
          video,,,,, from andrews comeback to the subtlety of the flirting to neils
          crazy psychotic dad to riko and everything else i literally never knew what
          was going to happen next like i was literally O-O) the whole time through all
          3 books..... anyway i loved it so so so much it was perfect.</p>

        <p><u>review:</u> extremely conflicted views on this book. after sleeping
          on my thoughts i have more clarity on how i view this book in terms of
          greatness and likeability. overall, i can see where the critiques came
          from and i fully accept them as valid complaints. however! reagrdless
          i still very much liked the book a lot, in order to verify if it makes
          it into the favorites shelf tho id need to read the following book(s?)
          to see where the story leads. i think each character singulary was developed
          perfectly,, but i dont think all character relationships were fully fledged.
          libby and nico had known each other for years and despite this i could not
          find a connection between the two. all of the characters felt very
          singular and not connected at all, there were moments where i had
          forgotten whose pov i was reading because so many characters were being
          referenced without any distinct connection. i could see the overarching
          plot and i knew not to expect anything great so i didnt really mind since
          im a great character person so,,, anyway i think id shelf it under my
          favs if i read the followup book, i liked how different and unique it was</p>
