        <p><u>review:</u> i liked this book,, it was an interesting and refreshing read,,
          murder mystery,,, it was very confusing at times since i never remembered all of
          the names/characters but i like how it was all one big time loop,, like i said it
          was enjoyable but not really my style and im not a big fan of open endings like that</p>

            <p><u>review:</u> ya this book sucked, i didnt know any of the characters,,
              like they had no personality, the timeline was confusing at best, i expected a
              fight or at least the two characters actively plottting against each other, the
              romance was extremely rushed in my opinion, and i hated it,, the only redeemable
              quality was the bailey and twins timeline but that didnt even become enjoyable until
               part 3 which was over halfway through the book,,, so,,,, bad book </p>

            <p><u>review:</u> its a cute book! i cant belive i read it in 5th grade tho,
              theres a lot fo descriptive words that i for sure didnt know the meaning of.
              the story was cute and simple, its sad that winnie never drank from the spring
              but its like one of those sad happy endings u know.</p>
